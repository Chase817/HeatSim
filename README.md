# HeatSim

HeatSim is a 2D heat equation solver/visualizer that simulates the flow of heat through a plate with the given conditions.

HeatSim solves the heat equation using the finite-distance numerical method, and supports both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.

Written in Python 3, HeatSim was an exercise in GUI development and object-oriented programming. Lots of time was spent finding a consise and powerful design that allows the user maximum control without unnecessary pages and UI elements. In addition, countless hours went into rewriting code to keep the program as stable and functional as possible.
